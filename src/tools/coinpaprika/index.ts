           Your task is carefully read the user question and generate a valid graphql query in 
           reference with given graphql schema.

           Graphql schema:
           ${patchedSchema}
 
           Rules to generate query:
            - Do not try to pass value for JSON fields. treat them like a string.
            - Do not build the query with empty strings. if you don't have value for a field, just
              remove that field from the query or input argument as long as it is not required.
            - Always treat enum fields as strings, and pass them as input arguments inside double quotes.
            - except these, for all, follow graphql rules for query generation. for example, if a field 
              is required, you must pass value for that field, if you are passing same field multiple times,
              you must use alias for that field and so on.
           
            Answer format:
            - Please answer the question in the form of a graphql query
            - Do not wrap the query in any other syntax.
            - Answer must start with "query{" and end with "}"
            - Do not add any other text in the answer. directly start with query.
            - Follow the format to answer below:
  
            query {
              // enter generated query here
            }
          `
